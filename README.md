# üåü Image Description Web Application

## Overview
The **Image Description Web Application** is a user-friendly web tool that allows users to upload an image and receive a textual description of its content. The application leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models for image classification and description generation. Built with **PyTorch** and **FastAPI** for backend processing, the frontend provides an elegant and intuitive interface using modern web technologies.

## Features

### üîß Backend
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 model from Hugging Face to generate accurate descriptions for uploaded images.
- **REST API**: FastAPI serves as the backbone, providing a robust and scalable REST API for handling image uploads and serving responses.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Automatically processes images to ensure compatibility with the model.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Designed for deployment on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or GCP.

### üé® Frontend
- **Modern Design**: Eye-pleasing interface with pastel gradients and dynamic elements.
- **Image Preview**: Displays a preview of the uploaded image for user convenience.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediately shows the generated image description after upload.

### üñ•Ô∏è Full Stack
- **Interactive**: Users can upload images, preview them, and receive detailed descriptions all within a seamless interface.
- **Responsive**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**:
  - PyTorch
  - FastAPI (REST API)
  - Hugging Face Transformers
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (with modern gradients and responsiveness)
  - JavaScript
- **Other Tools**:
  - PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing
  - FileReader API for live image previews

## How It Works
1. **Upload Image**: Users can upload any image via the intuitive file uploader.
2. **REST API Request**: The frontend sends the image to the backend using a POST request via the REST API endpoint.
3. **Image Processing**: The backend preprocesses the image and passes it to the ResNet-50 model.
4. **Generate Description**: The model predicts the most relevant class label as the image description.
5. **Display Output**: The frontend displays the description along with the uploaded image preview.
